# Final Project

# Impact of NBA Games on Chicago Traffic Accidents Analysis
## Project Proposal: 
### Goal: 
* Analyze the correlation between Chicago Bulls home games and traffic accident rates in Chicago
* Determine if there are specific patterns in accident locations near the United Center
### What I’ll do: 
* I’ll analyze weather data(rain with precipitation) for different days so I can control confounding variables.
* I’ll create heat maps of accident locations.
* I’ll analyze spatial distribution of accidents near location of NBA game like United Center(arena of Chicago Bulls)
*  I’ll calculate baseline accident rates for different days and compare these rates during game days vs non-game days.
* I’ll generate time series plots showing accident rates
* I’ll produce statistical summaries and use techniques (maybe significance tests) to analyze my statement.
* I’ll use machine learning techniques (such as LSTM, XGBoost, …)to predict the trend of traffic accident rates and find out the relationship between NBA games and Chicago traffic accidents rate.

## Project Execution Plan:
* By the end of week 4, 
    * I will have collected all the necessary data, including Chicago traffic accidents, NBA game schedules in Chicago (especially focusing on the Chicago Bulls), and weather data.
    * I will address any missing data or inconsistencies.
* By the end of week 5, 
    * I will have conducted initial exploratory data analysis, examining overall traffic accident trends, and comparing accident rates on game days vs non-game days.
    * I will also create initial time series plots to visualize trends in accident rates over time.
* By the end of week 6, 
    * I will have implemented controls for confounding variables like weather conditions.
    * I will calculate baseline accident rates under different weather conditions (e.g., rain vs no rain) and compare them to accident rates on game days to account for potential confounding effects.
* By the end of week 7, 
    * I will have performed spatial analysis, using heat maps and other tools to visualize accident locations, especially around the United Center.
    * I will assess whether there is clustering or unusual patterns on game days.
    * I will produce statistical summaries using significance tests (e.g., t-tests, chi-square) to analyze correlations.
* By the end of week 8, 
    * I will have built and trained machine learning models (e.g., LSTM, XGBoost) to predict accident rates based on historical data, including game schedules, weather conditions, and other relevant features.
    * I will evaluate the models' performance using appropriate metrics such as RMSE, accuracy, or AUC, and fine-tune them.
* Finally, 
    * I will have summarized all my findings and adjusted the layout of my final report to make it more readable, including visualizations like heatmaps, time series, and spatial analysis charts I completed earlier.
    * I will have prepared a presentation to showcase my analysis and conclusions on the relationship between NBA games and traffic accident rates in Chicago.
